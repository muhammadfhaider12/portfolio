## Projects

## [Instacart Market Basket  Analysis](https://github.com/muhammadfhaider12/InstacartMarketBasketAnalysis)  
The project deals with solving the business problem of online grocery delivery chains, Instacrt.The data of 3 million orders by 200000 customers has been analyzed to understand the customers' buying behaviours. K-Means algorithm and Market Basket Analysis have been applied for segmenting the customers based on their buying needss and discover the products association.For predicticg the customer's reordering probability, XGBoost Model and ANN model have been implemented to predict the customer's reordering probability. 

## [Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/muhammadfhaider12/loan-default-prediction)
In the following machine learning classification problem, the project aims to predict the customers whether they going to be default the loan or not based on the various financial features. The handle the imbalance data the combination of oversampling and undersampling knoen as SMOTEENN have been used. Logistic Regression, Random Forest with its hyperparters and CATBOOST models have been applied to solve the business need.  

## [Predicting UK Used  Cars Prices](https://github.com/muhammadfhaider12/predicting-uk-used-cars-prices)  
The main goal of the project is to predict the used car's price based their several features. To solve this machine learning regression problem, numerous data cleaning and feature enginnering approaches have been implentented during data exploration and preprocessing phase.Moreover, I have applied Decison Tree Regressor, Random Forest, XGBoost Model and KNearest Neighbour to attain the best results.

## [Pizza Sales Report Using PowerBI](https://github.com/muhammadfhaider12/pizza-sales-report-using-powerbi)    
The data visualiztion project has been carried out using Microsoft PowerBI to analyze the and extract the meaningful data insight to help the business to thrive by understanding customers' buying choices and patterns.
