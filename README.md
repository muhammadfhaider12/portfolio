## Projects

## [Instacart Market Basket  Analysis](https://github.com/muhammadfhaider12/InstacartMarketBasketAnalysis)  
The project deals with solving the business problem of the online grocery delivery chain, Instacart. The data of 3 million orders by 200000 customers has been analyzed to understand the customers' buying behaviors. K-Means algorithm and Market Basket Analysis have been applied to segment the customers based on their buying needs and discover the product association. For predicting the customer's reordering probability, the XGBoost Model and ANN model have been implemented to predict the customer's reordering probability. 

## [Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/muhammadfhaider12/loan-default-prediction)
In the following machine learning classification problem, the project aims to predict the customers whether they going to default on the loan or not based on the various financial features. The handle the imbalance data the combination of oversampling and undersampling known as SMOTEENN has been used. Logistic Regression, Random Forest with its hyperparameters, and CATBOOST models have been applied to solve the business need.  

## [Predicting UK Used  Cars Prices](https://github.com/muhammadfhaider12/predicting-uk-used-cars-prices)  
The main goal of the project is to predict the used car's price based on its several features. To solve this machine learning regression problem, numerous data cleaning and feature engineering approaches have been implemented during the data exploration and preprocessing phase. Moreover, I have applied the Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest, XGBoost Model, and KNearest Neighbour to attain the best results.

## [Pizza Sales Report Using PowerBI](https://github.com/muhammadfhaider12/pizza-sales-report-using-powerbi)    
The data visualization project has been carried out using Microsoft PowerBI to analyze and extract meaningful data insight to help the business to thrive by understanding customers' buying choices and patterns.
